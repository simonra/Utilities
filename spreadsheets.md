A collection of features and functions I don't use often, but are nice to have a simple summary of how work gathered in one place for when I need them.

# Computations using references

## Match

Takes a value, and finds the index/positon of it in a supplied range.

## Index

Takes a range and an index within that range, and returns the value at the position of that index.

## Putting it together

To retrieve a value from a dictionary you have defined for further use:

`INDEX(dictionary_values_range, MATCH(key, dictionary_keys_range))`
